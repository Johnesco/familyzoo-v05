create the Zoo Entrance
  a room
  aka entrance, gates, gate
  south to the Main Path

  first time
    Your family piles out of the car, buzzing with excitement — a
    whole day at the zoo! You straighten the strap of your backpack
    and take it all in. You stand before the wrought-iron gates of
    the Willowbrook Family Zoo. A cheerful welcome sign arches over
    the entrance, and a small ticket booth sits to one side. A
    sturdy iron fence runs along either side of the gates. The main
    path leads south into the zoo grounds.

  You stand before the wrought-iron gates of the Willowbrook Family Zoo.
  A cheerful welcome sign arches over the entrance, and a small ticket
  booth sits to one side. A sturdy iron fence runs along either side of
  the gates. The main path leads south into the zoo grounds.

  A wide gravel path winds through the heart of the zoo. Colorful
  direction signs point every which way. A park bench sits beside the

  gate blocks the path to the south. The entrance is back to the north.

create the Aviary
  a room
  aka bird house, dome

  You step inside a soaring mesh dome. Brilliantly colored parrots
  chatter from rope perches, and a toucan eyes you curiously from a
  branch overhead. A small waterfall splashes into a stone basin. An
  info plaque hangs near the entrance. The gift shop is to the west. The
  main path is back to the east.
